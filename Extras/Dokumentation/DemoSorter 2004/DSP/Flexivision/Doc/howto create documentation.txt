You need 3 packages:
 - doxygen: www.doxygen.org
 - graphviz: www.graphviz.org/
 - MS Help Workshop (only when wanted): 
     http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/htmlhelp/html/vsconHH1Start.asp
     (or google search "htmlhelp.exe")

(1) Make sure that the path environment variable contains the path of the graphviz and help workshop executables (The latter won't do that by itself).

(2) Run Doxywizard (installed with doxygen)

(3) Load the dwstest.dox

(4) Run it by pressing the icon in the toolbar.

(5) wait

The resulting documentation files can now be found in:
  dwstest_html:	The html (index.html) and MS help version (dwstest.chm)
  dwstest_rtf:  The RTF version (refman.rtf).

To use the RTF version, you first have to update all fields: load the refman.rtf file, press ctrl+A to select all and press F9.
