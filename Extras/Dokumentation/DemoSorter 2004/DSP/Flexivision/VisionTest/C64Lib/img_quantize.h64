*       The function IMG_quantize() quantizes matrices by multiplying their *
*       contents with a second matrix that contains reciprocals of the      *
*       quantization terms.  This step corresponds to the quantization      *
*       that is performed in 2-D DCT-based compression techniques,          *
*       although IMG_quantize() may be used on any signed 16-bit data using *
*       signed 16-bit quantization terms.                                   *
*                                                                           *
*       IMG_quantize() multiplies the contents of the quantization matrix   *
*       with the data being quantized.  Therefore, it may be used for       *
*       inverse quantization as well, by setting the Q-point                *
*       appropriately.                                                      *
*                                                                           *
*       The assembly code requires 26 + (blk_size/16) * num_blks * 8        *
*       cycles to execute, including function call overhead.  This code     *
*       does not explicitly disable interrupts.  On entry to the function,  *
*       interrupts are masked by branch delay slots for a maximum of 16     *
*       cycles.                                                             *
