*   DESCRIPTION                                                             *
*       The benchmark performs the vertical pass of 2D wavelet              *
*       transform It performs a vertical filter on 8 rows which are         *
*       pointed to by the pointers contained in an array of pointers.       *
*       It produces two lines worth of output, one being the low-pass       *
*       and the other being the high pass result. Instead of performing     *
*       a transpose on the column and re-using the wave_horz kernel,        *
*       the vertical filter is traversed over the entire width of the       *
*       line and the low pass and high pass filtering kernels are           *
*       performed together.                                                 *
*                                                                           *
*       This implies that the low-pass and highpass filters be              *
*       overlapped in execution so that the input data array may be         *
*       loaded once and both filters can be exceuted in parallel.           *
*                                                                           *
*   TECHNIQUES                                                              *
*       The inner loop that advances along each filter tap is totally       *
*       optimized by unrolling.  Double-word loads are performed, and       *
*       paired multiplies are used to perform four iterations of            *
*       low-pass filter in parallel.                                        *
*                                                                           *
*       For the high-pass kernel, the same loop is reused, in order         *
*       to save codesize.  This is done by loading the filter               *
*       coefficients in a special order.                                    *
*                                                                           *
*   ASSUMPTIONS                                                             *
*       Since the wavelet transform is dyadic, the image dimensions         *
*       "rows" and "cols" are assumed to be powers of 2.  No checking       *
*       is done within the code to ensure this.                             *
*                                                                           *
*       The input filters qmf and mqmf are assumed to be word aligned       *
*       and have exactly 8 taps.                                            *
*                                                                           *
*       The output data and input data on any line is assumed to be         *
*       dword-aligned.                                                      *
*                                                                           *
*       The mqmf filter is constructed from the qmf as follows:             *
*                                                                           *
*           status = -1;                                                    *
*           for (i = 0; i < M; i++)                                         *
*           {                                                               *
*               status = status * -1;                                       *
*               hdata  = qmf[i] * status;                                   *
*               filter[i] = hdata;                                          *
*           }                                                               *
*                                                                           *
*       The kernels assume that the number of filter taps is exactly        *
*       8.  In addition data that is loaded for producing out_ldata[0]      *
*       and out_hdata[0] is not identical. The data loaded for              *
*       producing out_hdata[0] produces results at the location             *
*                                                                           *
*           out_lstart = o_im + ((rows >> 1) - 3) * cols                    *
*           out_hstart = o_im + (rows >> 1) * cols                          *
*                                                                           *
*       Where o_im is start of output image, rows is # of rows of the       *
*       input image, and cols is # of cols of the output image.             *
*                                                                           *
*       The following table illustrates how ylptr and yhptr need to be      *
*       updated at the start of each call to this function:                 *
*                                                                           *
*       Call#        out_ldata                  out_hdata                   *
*         1          out_lstart                 out_hstart                  *
*         2          out_lstart + cols          out_hstart + cols           *
*         3          out_lstart + 2*cols        out_hstart + 2*cols         *
*                                                                           *
*       At this point ylptr wraps around to become o_im, while yhptr        *
*       proceeds as usual:                                                  *
*                                                                           *
*         4          o_im                       out_hstart + 3*cols         *
*                                                                           *
*       In addition the kernel accepts a pointer to an array of             *
*       pointers for each input line so that a working buffer of 10         *
*       lines can be used to effectively mix DMA's and processing as        *
*       shown below:                                                        *
*                                                                           *
*       ihptr                        LINE BUFFER                            *

*       ...                                                                 *

*       At the start of the kernel 8 input lines are filled to the          *
*       first 8 lines and processing begins.  In the background the next    *
*       two lines are fetched.  The pointers are moved up by 2 namely       *
*       ptr[i] = ptr[i+2] and the last two lines now point to lines 9       *
*       and 10 and processing starts again.  In the background the next     *
*       two lines are brought in the first two lines of the line            *
*       buffer.  Pointers move up again by 2 but now the last two           *
*       pointers to line 0 and 1.  This pattern then repeats.               *
*                                                                           *
*       The first line to begin filtering is always obtained from           *
*       ptr[0], the next from ptr[1] and so on.                             *
*                                                                           *

*       In order to eliminate bank conflicts succesive lines in the         *
*       line buffer or the pointers to these lines are seperated by         *
*       exactly two banks (one word) so that loads to any succesive         *
